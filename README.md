## What is WordGuess CLI?

Word Guess CLI is a game of hangman you can play in your terminal. Simply run the app to get a random word, and follow the prompts to guess letters that appear in the word.

## Getting Started

NPM dependencies:

- inquirer
- fs

After pulling this folder to your computer -- To use, please make sure to load all of your npm packages as listed above. And make sure all of the files are present.

## How to use

1. It's very easy to use LiriBot! Just run the app (node index.js) from your command line and follow the prompts.
2. When prompted, type in your letter guess
3. Hit "return" to see if the letter appears in the word you are guessing
4. Repeat as needed! But beware, you only have 10 guesses.
5. Run the app again to play again.
